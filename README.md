<img src="https://www.donovanlo.sg/readme/readme-cs.png" style="margin: 0;">

### Content Structure

	1. Home:
	It starts with a home page with a hero image introducing me. Things that are not found in traditional resume.
	It allow visitor a glimpse of my character and personality and understand me a little better.
	2. Resume: 
	The next page present the information visitor expected to see on a resume.
	The layout should be suitable for career changer. It should be effective in showing transferrable skills and experience. It will also contain a link for the visitor to download a pdf copy of the resume. The format of the pdf copy should be similar in layout with the 'resume' page.
	3. Portfolio
	For visitor to look for more evidence of my skills, the projects are presented in the third page.
	It contains the names, descriptions, github hyperlinks of the current and past projects. Having a page dedicated to the projects allows the growth of the listing without affecting the layout of the other pages.

    Exception:
    Contact
	The call for action of the site is to get the hiring manager to contact me.
	So the Contact section is embedded into the footer of every page .
	It provide different means to get in touch with me as well as a contact form.
	The visitor can easily drop me a mail without needing to go out of the site to their email application to do so.

The principles of choices are taken into account. The content are organised into 3 pages.
The system applies the labelling system by using short single words (Home, Resume and  Portfolio) which can easily recognised by the visitor.

Applying the principles of front doors, the users should be able to identify where they are in the site regardless of which page they landed. 
There will also be a navigation system for the visitor to jump to specific section should they decided to.

The principle of growth is considered when the projects are all group under the portfolio page. It will be easy to expand this section without affect the overall structure or other parts of the designs.
If there's a need for another sections or break one of these page into two, it can be easily done.
